# This is ProGuard configuration for instrumented test APK. This APK is not
# statically linked to instrumented APK, which is a stand-alone application
# version. Instead, both APK share the same process.

# Since both APK are separately processed by ProGuard, calling instrumented
# APK methods from instrumented test APK is not easy. The methods in
# instrumented APK can be obfuscated or optimized away. Those that are to
# be called must be whitelisted in instrumented APK ProGuard configuration.

# The optimization level of instrumented test APK does not matter, so we
# disable all optimizations to save build time.
